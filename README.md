🛠️ Usage

1.Preprocess the data: python preprocess.py 2.Train the model: python train.py 3.Run the web app: streamlit run app.py 4.Make predictions:

📊 Model Training The model is trained using a dataset of labeled emails. The training pipeline includes:

1.Text preprocessing (removing stop words, stemming, etc.) 2.Feature extraction using TF-IDF 3.Model training using a selected classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) 4.Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

📈 Results Metric Value Accuracy 0.95 Precision 0.94 Recall 0.96 F1-Score 0.95

🧰 Technologies 1.Programming Language: Python 2.Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, Streamlit 3.NLP: NLTK, TF-IDF
